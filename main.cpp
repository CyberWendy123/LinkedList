* what am I trying to accomplish? 
* 	to better understand this data structure, I am going to use Object Oriented 
*	programming to have a linked list of: (from the .txt file)
* why would people choose Linked List? (over arrays)
*	-	predictability (constant-time insertions/deletions from the list)
*	-	you don't need how many items in a list 
*	-	you don't need random access to any elements 
*	-	want to be able to insert items in the middle of hte list (e.g. priority queue)
